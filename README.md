# General Assembly WDI Project 2

For the 2nd Project at General Assembly we were instructed to explore an app that used models and relationships.

We were given 1 week and I really wanted to work on trying to create a solution to a problem that was part of my day to day.

Since starting GA I've noticed that even though I have tons of calendars and reminders to keep up to date with events things still slip through the net.

I wanted an app that would make sure I wouldn’t forget important events and in my experience when someone text’s me “Did you remember X?” or “Don’t forget about Y” I tend to have a better success rate of “remembrance.”

Given the nature of the problem I also wanted to make a 'phone-only' web app as part of my design

# Here are some things I'd like to improve

* Build in the reminder as an automated aspect of the app so it sends sms periodically
* Animate the fade out
* Release the app on the apple app store
